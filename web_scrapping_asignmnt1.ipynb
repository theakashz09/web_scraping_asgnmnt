        "\n",
        "Ans = Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting large amounts of data from websites. It typically involves using software, scripts, or bots to collect and parse data from the HTML of web pages. The extracted data can be stored in a structured format like a database or spreadsheet for further analysis or use.\n",
        "Web Scraping Uses:\n",
        "1.Data Collection: Web scraping helps gather information that may not be available in easily downloadable formats, such as CSV or APIs. It automates the extraction process, saving time and effort.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Automation: Instead of manually copying data from websites, scraping tools can automatically extract and update data from web sources in real-time or on scheduled intervals.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Competitive Intelligence: It is often used for market research or to gain insights into competitors by tracking prices, product listings, reviews, and trends across different platforms.\n",
